## Manual setup

step by step how to create and the code explanations

1. First of all this is the python main logic code

```py
import os
import textwrap
import google.generativeai as genai
import re

# Set the Google API Key (replace with your actual key)
your_api_key = "AIzaSyAFjcMyHH6bwGVAlIo-qGGdx6YrL_HCuXU"
os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'] = your_api_key

# Configure Google Generative AI
genai.configure(api_key=os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'])

def to_markdown(text):
    """Converts plain text to Markdown format with bullets.

    Args:
        text: The plain text string to convert.

    Returns:
        A string containing the Markdown formatted text.
    """
    text = text.replace('•', '  *')  # Use two spaces for better formatting
    # Indent each line
    return textwrap.indent(text, '> ', predicate=lambda _: True)

def is_terminal_question(question):
    """Checks if the question is related to the Linux terminal.

    Args:
        question: The input question string.

    Returns:
        A boolean indicating if the question is related to the Linux terminal.
    """
    keywords = [
        'linux', 'terminal', 'command', 'shell', 'bash', 'cli', 'script', 
        'unix', 'kernel', 'sudo', 'root', 'chmod', 'chown', 'apt-get', 
        'yum', 'package', 'install', 'update', 'grep', 'awk', 'sed', 'vi', 'vim', 'nano'
    ]
    return any(re.search(r'\b' + keyword + r'\b', question, re.IGNORECASE) for keyword in keywords)

# List available models that support text generation
print("Available models for text generation:")
for model in genai.list_models():
    if 'generateContent' in model.supported_generation_methods:
        print(model.name)

# Load the generative model (replace 'gemini-1.5-pro-latest' if desired)
model_name = 'gemini-1.0-pro'
model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name)

print("Welcome to the Genie command! You can ask me questions about the Linux terminal.")
while True:
    question = input("Enter your question (or type 'exit' to quit): ")
    if question.lower() == "exit":
        print("Exiting Genie command. Goodbye!")
        break
    
    # Append "in Ubuntu" to the question
    question_with_ubuntu = question + " in Ubuntu"
    
    if is_terminal_question(question_with_ubuntu):
        response = model.generate_content(question_with_ubuntu)
        print("Genie:")
        print(to_markdown(response.text))
    else:
        print("Genie: I'm sorry, I only answer bash specific questions.")


<br/>
<br/>

The logic behind keeping genie only in the topic of bash commands is by passing a pre prompt that engineers the output for a specific case

```py
text="Help with any question I ask about Linux bash commands only in very summarized answer with a short example usage and don't add any markdown styling make sure all the output you give is pair text. other wise if my question is off topic please only answer politely by refusing to answer this question. So my questions is : "+" ".join(sys.argv[1:])
```
<br /><br /><br />
2. Now about how to convert the normal python code into a ready to install application for any Debian based Linux disruptions
by copying the above code don't forget to set your own API key [in this step](#get-your-own-api-key)
and set it in a file named `genie.py`
get the path of the file
```bash
pwd ./genie.py
```
copy the output and add `/genie.py` at the end of it
```bash
pwd genie

/home/<usrName>
```
thus the path is : 
`/home/<usrName>/genie.py`
copy it and keep it for the next step.

do the following 
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

this will open a file for you in which go to `last line` in the file and add the following : 
```bash
alias genie='python3 /home/<usrName>/genie.py'
```

Now you are behind one step from the glow!
update the new settings for the system to read by doing : 
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
<br />
Now you can use genie just as like as you would use the installed geny from the mesba7
